CODENAME: TPB

Objective:
File-sharing website that the file management system is based in torrenting.  The reason why we are using torrenting is because we do not have a lot of storage space to store larger files, so we can store smaller files on the server with torrents.  We plan on using a Gazelle-based tracker.
